# HMM
Course Project - Natural Language Processing

Phase 1: 
In this project, the functions of forward and viterbi are completed, and the result of forward is output to result/p1/log_0.0.txt, and the result of word in test.txt predicted by viterbi is output to result/p1/prediction_0.0.txt. The accuracy is greater than 89%.

Phase 2:
In this phase, the backward algorithm is completed, and the e and m steps of em are implemented. After that, iterations of the em algorithm were performed 30 times, and the results of the likelihood were output to the log file. The result of the prediction based on the iterated lambda is output to the prediction file with an accuracy rate of 65%.
